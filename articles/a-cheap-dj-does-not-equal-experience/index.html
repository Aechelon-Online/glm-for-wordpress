            <p class="blog__header">You want the <a class="blog__link" href="https://greglucemusic.com">best entertainment</a>, and weddings aren't cheap. But, hey, one DJ is just good as the next, right?. And let's face it, no one wants a boring reception with bad music. So why on earth would you hire a cheap DJ? That's like trying to save money by buying a used toilet seat at a garage sale. It's just a bad idea.</p>
            <p class="blog__p">First, you don't want a DJ who is more experienced at playing video games than music. Hiring low-ball entertainment is like trying to fly a plane with someone who has only ever played Microsoft Flight Simulator. Sure, they know how to press the buttons, but do you really want to take that risk? No, you want someone who can read the crowd and play the right song at the right time.</p>
            <p class="blog__p">Oh, yeah. There's the issue of equipment. A bottom-feeder DJ will probably show up with equipment that is older than the first iPhone. You don't want to hear your first dance song through speakers that sound like a dying cat. Invest in a professional who has invested in their own equipment and you'll have a reception that sounds like you're at a concert, not a funeral.</p>
            <p class="blog__p">Reliability is also important regarding music entertainment. A cheap DJ might be a flake who will cancel on you at the last minute, leaving you to play Spotify on your phone for the reception. You don't want to have to be the one who tells your guests "sorry, the DJ bailed, but we've got a killer playlist of '90s pop hits".</p>
            <p class="blog__p">Furthermore, you want a DJ who is not only a DJ but also a master of ceremonies. You want a DJ who can keep the energy high and keep on schedule. You want an experienced DJ to handle MC duties smoothly and professionally. You DEFINITELY do NOT want a DJ who spends the whole night checking their phone and playing TikTok videos.</p>
                
            <p class="blog__footer">So, counting on a bottom of the bucket record spinner is like trying to save money by buying expired milk. Sure, it might seem like a good idea at the time, but it's going to end up costing you in the long run. Invest in a <a class="blog__link" href="https://greglucemusic.com">quality DJ</a> who has the experience, equipment and skills to make your reception unforgettable. And let's face it, you want <a class="blog__link" href="https://greglucemusic.com">everyone to remember your reception for the amazing music</a>, not the terrible DJ.</p>
